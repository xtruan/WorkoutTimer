# Workout Timer
Workout Timer app for Garmin ConnectIQ - https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/1341159e-2ed9-4065-9049-0157b0419e1f

Countdown timer app for measuring sections of workouts. Useful for measuring rest periods between lifting, holding poses in body line work, and many more activities.

Usage:
* Menu soft key or up button to select default countdown time (can choose from 0:30, 1:00, 1:30, 2:00, or Custom)
    * Custom time only supported on some devices (FR55 is not supported). IQ! when selecting a custom time means it is unsupported.
* Tap screen or press enter button (start/stop) to start and pause timer
* Hold screen or press down button to reset timer to selected default
* "Repeat" option in menu toggles auto-repeat mode

Make sure vibration is enabled to make the most of this app!
